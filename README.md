# Loan-Prediction
### About the comapny

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

### Problem

Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

### Approach 

After cleaning the dataset that includes filling missing values , removing outliers , removing skewness and kurtosis .
I have applied some feature selection techniques like Sequential Feature Selection , Exhaustive Feature Selection , SelectFromModel , Chi2 , Anova test and feature selection using pearson correlation . After preparing dataset now we will formulate our model . I have used basic machine learning models like Logistic Regression , Decision Tree , Random Forest , Lasso , Ridge , Bagging Classifier , Stacking Classifier , Gradient Bossting and ADABoosting.

We acheived a accuracy of 81.25% using gradient boosting classifier.

Lastly , We have a current rank of 45 for this competition .

It is an ongoing competition , so our rank would of course decrease .

But as and when required , we would like to learn new skills and grow each and everyday . And therefore , we would bring our new skills to test by aiming for a better rank in the future

### Rank Order Analysis 
Supplemented the ML model with a Rank Order Analysis for Monitoring puposes 
•	Targeted an optimal pool of customers by deploying a Strategic Model (Rank Order) thus minimizing the cost and maximizing the ROI by 2.5X 
•	Achieved 83% of the Total Profit by reaching out to 1/3rd of the population
